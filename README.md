# 📚 InPlace – Interactive Node-based Platform for Learning Algorithms, Code & Execution

InPlace is a hands-on educational platform where every Data Structure and Algorithm is not only explained — it's brought to life with interactive, real-world implementations. Each concept page is crafted using the **very data structure** it teaches.

---

## 🔥 What Makes InPlace Unique?

✅ **Every concept is implemented using itself**  
On the "Array" page? It's powered by arrays. Learning queues? The demo is a real queue!  
InPlace teaches by building.

✅ **Real-World Visual Demos**  
Instead of abstract examples, you'll learn with practical simulations:

- 🛒 **Amazon Cart System**  
  An array holds a dynamic cart. Add/remove items and see the cart update in real time.

- 🎬 **Netflix Watchlist**  
  Easily append and reorder movies in a state-managed array — just like a real watchlist.

- 📺 **YouTube Video Queue**  
  Simulates a queue with autoplay, reordering, and skips — powered by dynamic array state.

✅ **"Under the Hood" Section**  
An interactive explanation area that:
- Lists how arrays work in each demo
- Is itself **rearrangeable via drag-and-drop**
- Built using `Array.map()` — so yes, even this list is powered by arrays ✨

## 🧠 What You'll Learn

- How linear data structures (arrays, queues) are used in real applications
- State management through arrays in React
- Practical usage of array methods like `push()`, `splice()`, `map()`, and `filter()`
- Drag-and-drop UI logic with Framer Motion
- Visualization and live data structure behavior

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Next.js 13+** with App Router
- **React** with functional components
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Framer Motion** for animations and drag handling
- **Lottie React** for real-time SVG animations
