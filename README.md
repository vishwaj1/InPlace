Here's your updated and enhanced **README** for **InPlace**, incorporating all the awesome features we built together today:

# 📚 InPlace – Interactive Node-based Platform for Learning Algorithms, Code & Execution

**InPlace** is a hands-on educational platform where every **Data Structure** and **Algorithm** is not only explained — it's brought to life with interactive, real-world implementations. Each concept page is crafted using the **very data structure** it teaches.

---

## 🔥 What Makes InPlace Unique?

✅ **Every concept is implemented using itself**  
On the "Array" page? It's powered by arrays. Learning trees? You're literally building one!  
InPlace teaches by building.

✅ **Real-World Visual Demos**  
Instead of abstract examples, you’ll learn with practical simulations:

- 🛒 **Amazon Cart System** (Array)  
  Dynamically manage cart items with array operations like `push`, `splice`, `map`.

- 🎬 **Netflix Watchlist** (Array)  
  Append, index, and reorder movies — just like a real-world watchlist.

- 📺 **YouTube Video Queue** (Array as Queue)  
  Autoplay, reordering, and skipping simulate real video queues.

- 🌳 **Tree Builder**  
  Add nodes with parent-child hierarchy. Visualize tree structure with animated links.

- 🌐 **Graph Visualizer**  
  Create and connect nodes in a circular layout. Each node is draggable and interactive.

---

## 🌱 Structure Visualizer

The homepage mimics the **actual data structure hierarchy** with:

- Primitive vs Non-Primitive bifurcation
- Linear vs Non-Linear split
- Reusable, interactive tree visualization using `reactflow`

---

## 🧠 What You’ll Learn

- Where and how data structures are used in modern apps
- How arrays, stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, and graphs function in practice
- Interactive DSA concepts powered by actual state and logic
- Live rendering and dynamic updates via React
- Using `reactflow`, `framer-motion`, and other modern tools for visualization

---

## 💡 Under the Hood

Every real-world use case includes an “Under the Hood” section:

- 📌 Explains which operations are being used
- 🔁 Rearranged interactively via drag-and-drop (built using arrays!)
- ✨ Even this explainer is powered by the concept it teaches

## 🧪 Current Demos & Progress

| Data Structure | Interactive Demos |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Array          | Amazon Cart, YouTube Queue, Netflix Watchlist |
| Stack          | Vertical push/pop with top pointer + stack overflow |
| Queue          | Horizontal queue layout with front/rear & transitions |
| Linked List    | Dynamic linking, insertion, deletion simulation |
| Tree           | Build tree via parent ID, auto-connected visual tree |
| Graph          | Circular layout, drag-n-drop nodes, edge creation |
